		<description><![CDATA[Typing regarding the Inspiron 15&#039;s keyboard is nice and 
cozy, no complaints at all. According to HP&#039;s website, the most cost effective computer 
could be the HP Pavilion p6300z, with a base expense of $299.
Third party warranties could cause major problems as replacements parts might not exactly be 
guaranteed plus it will take longer for that system to become repaired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It depends on the router - but usually the router will have an activity light, indicating that it&#039;s transmitting wireless signal. In addition, the router will usually have an Internet connectivity light, to indicate whether you have properly setup your connection settings in the router.
