				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in this digital world almost every business relies on technology for smooth operations and efficiency. This is why it&#8217;s so important and beneficial at the same time to replace your outdated technology as much as possible. The loss in productivity and any downtime due to outdated or faulty technology can seriously impact your business growth and result in long terms financial implications. However, for most business owners it becomes quite difficult to determine when it&#8217;s the right time to change or migrate your business technology.  Choosing the </span><a href="https://preemo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best technology </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for your business can be a difficult task. After all, when you are investing in technology, you want to make sure that it&#8217;s the one your business requires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you still on the fence whether it&#8217;s the right time to upgrade technology or not? Well, it might be the right time to upgrade your business technology if you run across any of the following warning signs.</span></p>
<p><b>SECURITY PURPOSES</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think that your systems are under frequent hits by online criminals and hackers, then go with your gut feeling and change them. In a few cases, outdated and faulty technology is more vulnerable to cyber attacks and security breaches. Nowadays, hackers or cybercriminals are coming up with new ways to attack your systems and steal all your important data and information, so beware and ditch the old systems before they ditch you.</span></p>
<p><b>UNDERLYING PROBLEMS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest reasons to upgrade your business technology is to solve the underlying problems. If you lack the right technology, chances are your company&#8217;s operations may suffer. If your network is not able to handle your website traffic or if your systems are hampering the productivity of your business, it may be the right time to invest in new technology. In simple terms, most of your business issues can be solved by simply upgrading your business technology.</span></p>
<p><b>DATA CORRUPTION AND LOSS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you own a large enterprise or a small-sized business, keeping data secure and safe is of the utmost importance. Outdated technology or systems can out your business at high risk of security breaches or increased cyber attacks. Also, old-fashioned systems and servers are vulnerable to crashes and cost you both time and money.</span></p>
<p><b>YOUR BUSINESS’S FIRM IS GROWING</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot compare the technology required when your business small in operation with what your business needs today since it has developed. New employees and more departments mean that you need to invest in the equipment and tools required to support your business goals. In short, the further the business grows, the greater the need to opt for new technology and systems.</span></p>
<p><b>HOW PREEMO CAN HELP YOU</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anyone the above-mentioned scenarios arise, don&#8217;t wait to take action.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare facilities such as clinics and hospitals have a constant flow of all types of people coming in and going out. These spaces are highly trafficked at all times, that makes both entry and exit of every individual quite difficult to track. With all the medical services a hospital can offer, ensuring proper safety and protection to the healthcare professionals, patients, their relatives, and other staff in the organization is an important responsibility. This is having security cameras installed in Miami clinics and hospitals gives a sense of protection to everyone present there. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://preemo.com/cctv-security-surveillance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCTV and surveillance systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also help healthcare facilities cut down additional expenses and reduce liability. These devices offer much more than just peace mind, correctly installed and configured security systems play a very important role in any healthcare facility&#8217;s integrated security solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are so many advantages to having security cameras in hospitals and clinics,  one tends to neglect the presence of these gadgets in Miami. We have compiled a few reasons why it&#8217;s so important to have security cameras in your healthcare organization.</span></p>
<p><strong>A SENSE OF INCREASED SECURITY AND SAFETY</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A kind of security and protection is important to ensure the safety of individuals. Hospitals and clinics, being the public spots and most trafficked space, securing them from criminal activities such as theft and vandalism becomes a crucially important task. The presence of high-quality security camera at each and every corner of the healthcare facility helps you know if anyone is a part of an unwanted or illegal activity. Also, having CCTV security systems installed gives you both audio and video footage of what is happening in the hospital.</span></p>
<p><strong>IMPROVES EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, every employee in your healthcare facility must be hardworking, but somewhere you are very well aware of the fact that there are few that do not work at full capacity. This is where security cameras come into play. When your employees know that they are being watched and their movements are being captured, they are more likely to put a little more efforts in that they actually do. Hence, CCTV cameras can be the best means to increase employees productivity in your organization.</span></p>
<p><strong>AVOID FALSE CLAIMS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">False and dishonest claims are the common allegations that several healthcare organizations come across.  In many cases, patients and other visitors claim to get seriously injured by hospital and clinic properties. In such situations, video footages act as evidence and are used to debunk such false claims. The best thing is having security cameras installed in the hospitals helps avoid unwanted insurance claims.</span></p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those mentioned above were some of the great benefits of installing CCTV cameras in Miami’s healthcare centers. But, be sure you to keep the privacy of the patients when installing CCTV cameras at hospitals. Reach out to us at</span><a href="https://preemo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Preemo </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the right installation of security cameras in your Miami’s hospital.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand new era of </span><a href="https://preemo.com/managed-it-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed IT services </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already arrived, and its rapid evolution has completely changed the process of service delivery and IT infrastructure operations within the past few years. IT has become an important part of every business, nowadays there are enough advanced technology solutions available out there in order to make the business operations smooth and efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is hiring a reliable</span><a href="https://preemo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IT company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for managing and assisting with all your  IT needs at your business a hard decision to make? As there are many IT companies out there to choose from, appointing the one you would like to work with can be quite difficult. To help you, we have compiled a few important points to consider before finalizing your decision.</span></p>
<p><b>TESTIMONIALS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a good thing if you know someone like your friends or colleagues who have used a particular IT support company in the past and had a great experience, then it&#8217;s the perfect place to start. But, there is no guarantee that you are going to get the same services from the company, so it&#8217;s better to choose an IT support company at random.</span></p>
<p><b>AVAILABILITY</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike humans, networks never sleep, and it&#8217;s better if your IT support won&#8217;t sleep. So, keep those IT support providers at the bay who make you feel ignored- doesn&#8217;t answer your calls or reply your emails. It&#8217;s wise to choose a dependable  IT Support company that takes pride in offering excellent customer support. An ideal IT support provider like Preemo always respond to the client’s queries and react to the threats and alerts 24/7/365.</span></p>
<p><b>GREATER EMPLOYEE SUPPORT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes systems can be quite frustrating. It&#8217;s no secret that nothing works slower than an unhappy employee, distressed with the lack of helpful resources in order to make their job easier. This is why providing the best tech support to you can help them more attentive and happier, thereby boosting your business productivity. When looking out for an IT provider, make sure to pick the one who delivers quick answers and also use remote access for resolving IT issues quickly.</span></p>
<p><b>REGULAR MAINTENANCE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your IT systems and servers go down due to a technical issue, all you need to ensure that the IT support company you choose can act quickly and get you back things on the right track. Your IT support provider should not sit back waiting for a data loss or something to break. Proactive and periodic maintenance keeps all your systems functioning like brand new at all times.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with a ransomware or an online attack is a major issue for the entire business affecting every team within the company. It&#8217;s also an operational and people issue,  rather than just being a technical problem. Have you heard the very famous saying “prevention is better than cure”? But, what if the prevention was not good enough to take care of your organization&#8217;s data and information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a data breach is discovered, it&#8217;s imperative to act both quickly and comprehensively, otherwise, it may expose your organization to a greater liability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to cybersecurity of your business, prevention is always important and better than cure. But, what&#8217;s more, important is that you and your business team should know and understand what exactly needs to be done after an online attack or ransomware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, you will learn about the three important things that need to be done immediately following a cyber attack.</span></p>
<p><b>1. STAY CALM- DO NOT PANIC</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may be easier said than actually done, it&#8217;s wise to stay calm and avoid panicking after enduring a cyber attack.  A ransomware or cyber attack, no doubt can be classified as a disastrous event. But by staying calm in such a scenario, you will be able to act smart and take the right steps and respond to the situation in an organized way.</span></p>
<p><b>2. CONTACT THE IMPACTED CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS   </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is likely to be the most difficult step, but it&#8217;s all about being proactive. After the event of a cyber attack, you and your team need to contact all the clients that are impacted in the disaster and narrate them the whole scene.  Ask them to change their PIN numbers and passwords in case their private information was hampered. Remember that a reactive approach, when you confirm a security breach or an online attack after they realize their data and information has been comprised or stolen by the hackers can damage your reputation. Your clients and customers may have many questions that they want to ask you. So, be prepared in order to handle the situation wisely.</span></p>
<p><b>3. PREVENT FUTURE ONLINE ATTACKS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you put your systems and services back online after enduring a ransomware and cyber attack, it&#8217;s important to make sure that you review all your business procedures and safeguard everything you have in your organization. You can take experts’ help in order to insect your systems and guide you on how they can be improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the average business organizations are becoming an easy target for cyber attacks. Whether you have recently been hit or just want to prevent cyber attacks in the future, our highly trained experts at Preemo can help. We specialize in </span><a href="https://preemo.com/network-support-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Support &amp; Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses in Miami.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of online attacks or ransomware cases in hospitals, however, is increasing as hackers are now focusing their efforts away from retail industries to an unprotected sector that is hospitals. More than 80% of all ransomware attacks tend to hit the healthcare centers.  These online attacks can be quite devastating preventing doctors to provide the right care to their patients. As a result, this makes the hospital more likely to pay the ransom in order to get their important files and other sensitive medical records back, encouraging hackers or online criminals to hit more medical centers.</span></p>
<p><b>WANT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RANSOMWARE IS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, ransomware is a type of malicious software or malware, that tend to take over the systems of an organization, denying it access to the data and information stored in them. The hackers or attackers then, demands a ransom, ensuring that restoration of the access once it&#8217;s paid. This makes the payment impossible to track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online criminals have attacked many sitting ducks (health care centers) that they make it look like the easiest task to perform. So, being a little proactive and careful, it&#8217;s easy to make a healthcare too difficult to hit so that attackers will look elsewhere. So how can an organization prevent a ransomware attack? Our highly trained IT technicians at </span><a href="https://preemo.com/contact"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preemo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer great advice to help healthcare centers prevent a ransomware attack.</span></p>
<p><b>PERIODIC CYBER SAFETY TRAINING </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the key you that can prevent your employees from clicking on and opening the emails or files containing a virus or malware. Every hospital should hold periodic training for their staff members. Also, healthcare firms should warn their employees not to use USB flash drives unless they are sure that the devices are obtained from a reliable and trusted source.</span></p>
<p><b>UPDATING SOFTWARE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare centers should already have reliable, trusted and high- level security software. Unfortunately, many healthcare centers are still using outdated software for their day to day operations. Neglecting to get the latest version of your software can leave all the systems and devices vulnerable to online attacks. Also, the attackers take the advantage of your outdated software, as they are an easy target for them and you won&#8217;t be able to fight against the threatening ransomware attacks. So, don&#8217;t put off the software updates, no matter how busy you are.</span></p>
<p><b>REGULAR BACKUPS </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backing up your data periodically ensures that you have access to all your data and information event in the event of your systems are attacked. Also, make sure that you store data on a different network as well, criminals can hit any backups on your network. Doing this can remove the motivation for attackers to conduct any type of online attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By following the above-stated pointers, any healthcare organization can stay safe by preventing a cyber attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsure, if your organization is protected against cyber attack or ransomware?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><a href="https://preemo.com/cctv-security-surveillance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCTV and Surveillance Systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are generally installed in places for safety and security purposes, there are endless benefits of installing security systems around the school premises too. Running a school is a big responsibility. The larger the school premises are, the more there are chances of mishaps.  Recently, it has become vitally important to maintain high-grade security and safety in schools. The security systems can monitor the actions of staff members and students, seize the misbehavior of teachers and pupils, incidents of bullying and other movements that have been proved to be one of the best ways to promote security and safety on schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many schools in Miami that have invested in security technology and have grabbed the amazing benefits of maintaining a more secure and safe school. There are several benefits that CCTV cameras and security systems can bring to the schools. Some of them are listed below.</span></p>
<p><b>GENERAL SECURITY AND PROTECTION</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investment in CCTV cameras and other security systems by school authority ensures guardians and parents that their children are safe in the school premises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also,  the general their general protection are being addressed during the school hours and during the after-school activities and extra classes.</span></p>
<p><b>CRIME DETERRENT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having CCTV cameras installed in schools will deter students and other pupils from indulging in criminal activities as their movements will be captured in camera. The presence of a security system will stop them from committing crimes such as theft, vandalism and other illegal activities. When the individuals know they are under CCTV surveillance, they are usually on their best behavior. But, in case these acts do occur, security systems will provide the evidence needed to catch the criminal and his or her crime accordingly.</span></p>
<p><b>BETTER EDUCATIONAL ADVANCEMENT</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With cameras installed in classrooms, it&#8217;s easier to identify students who are not attending the classes or who are not returning to the class after breaks. The presence of security systems has to lead to positive reports that student’s grades and attendance have improved to a great extent. And discipline is no more an issue now.</span></p>
<p><b>PREVENT BULLYING</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new security systems nowadays come with advanced features like audio, sound, and voice capturing capabilities. Unruly students bullying or harassing other students can be questioned based on both audio and video footage records. Thus, it&#8217;s needless to mention how helpful security systems are.</span></p>
<p><b>WATCH BUSY CORRIDORS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the crowded areas such as playgrounds and corridors, incidents tend to happen simply because of traffic congestion. While most of these incidents are minor that can be ignored, major incidents need evidence to be solved. Security cameras installed in the school can provide the right evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, CCTV and Surveillance Systems in schools help to ensure a healthy and secure learning environment for students.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://preemo.com/cctv-security-surveillance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCTV and security surveillance systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not only effective but also the best way to keep your both your business and residential property safe and protected. So, if you have decided to install CCTV cameras in your workplace, you already are aware of the importance of security system for your business. Security in your office has become increasingly complicated over recent years, ranging from dealing the onsite crimes and frauds, as well as other technology related issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to get the security systems to function properly, it&#8217;s imperative to choose the right service to both sell and install the device for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you will look out for the best Miami’s </span><a href="https://preemo.com/cctv-security-surveillance"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CCTV installation companies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the internet, you will be surprised to see the number of options that will show up on the list.  This will even complicate the process of choosing the best one out of many. In order to pick the best option, many business owners in Miami are likely to commit some dangerous mistakes. Today, in this blog our experts at Preemo has highlighted a few costly mistakes that you need to avoid when searching for a good and reliable CCTV installation company.</span></p>
<p><strong>CHOOSING THE FIRST OPTION YOU MEET</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first and most common mistake that you need to stay away when looking for a good CCTV installation company. You should never rely on the first option that you come across. It&#8217;s advisable to check at least four to five companies and compare their prices, services, and other offers. Sticking to the services of the first company may keep you away from the best one.  But, by checking as many as options you can, you get a chance you pick the best one.</span></p>
<p><strong>BUYING ONLY ONE CAMERA</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some business owners think that installing only one CCTV camera at their office entrance is enough to ensure the complete protection and safety of their business. Installing only one device for the overall security of your workplace can be both silly and expensive mistake. You never know, criminals and thieves can get into your office from any area.  This is why it&#8217;s so important to install at least four to five security systems at different points in your workplace in order to ensure the security of your business.</span></p>
<p><strong>NOT CONSIDERING THE LIGHTING</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another biggest mistake made by many people when buying CCTV cameras. It&#8217;s very wrong that can cost you a fortune to purchase CCTV and security surveillance systems without considering the lighting in your space. Overlooking the lighting can result in poor quality footages. It&#8217;s better to test the devices to see which camera model work best in the lighting conditions present in your office premises.</span></p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those mentioned above are just a few of the mistakes that most people make when buying CCTV camera for their office.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business in Miami no matter the type and size are nowadays saying goodbye to the outdated telecoms in record numbers, with a hope to grab all the benefits of advanced features and capabilities of </span><a href="https://preemo.com/voip-telephony-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This advanced communication service has gained a good following because of its outstanding benefits from reducing the phone bills to offering private faxes and several more. Unfortunately, not all the companies in Miami are able to reap these benefits as many of them often end up choosing the wrong VoIP providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this strong reason, we at Preemo have listed down some of the most common mistakes made by businesses when hiring a VoIP service provider. So, keep the below-listed pointers in mind and make a wise choice.</span></p>
<p><b>1. NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT VoIP TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have finally decided to choose a VoIP service provider for your business, it&#8217;s important to make sure that you and your employees how the VoIP technology works. Explore different worlds, and try to become an expert on what is VoIP technology and how it works. Learning the basics can surely help you avoid the critical mistakes that some VoIP providers might not tell you.</span></p>
<p><b>2. HIRING AN INEXPERIENCED OR NEW VoIP PROVIDER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing a new or inexperienced VoIP service provider in the industry for your business is one of the biggest and expensive mistakes any business could ever make. Apart from having no or a little knowledge about deploying their service, they might also be using your company just to test their service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid these expensive risks,  invest some time, do a bit of research and opt for a reliable and established VoIP service provider who has been delivering the services for several years in the market. The length of time is a mark of quality and high-grade services, happy and satisfied clients.</span></p>
<p><b>3. NOT PERFORMING A NETWORK TEST</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many VoIP service providers in Miami that won&#8217;t bother about evaluating your current network to check whether or not it&#8217;s capable of handling the VoIP system that you need for your business. If your potential VoIP service provider is one of those providers, ask them to perform a network test. If they deny your request or give you silly excuses, do your business a favor and search for a new </span><a href="https://preemo.com/voip-telephony-solutions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoIP service provider.</span></a></p>
<p><b>MAKE A WISE CHOICE!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the top three mistakes you should avoid when searching for a VoIP provider in the market, so you do not need to worry later on.
